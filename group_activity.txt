CASE STUDY: PORTFOLIO HEDGING WITH FUTURES 
 
 
In the wake of significant geopolitical shifts, TQM Hedge Fund, a leading entity specializing in 
macro strategies, finds itself navigating through a landscape fraught with increasing political and 
trade tensions. The recent policies enacted by the new US administration, particularly the 
imposition of tariffs on key imports, have set off a chain reaction of retaliatory measures from 
major trading partners. These developments have profound macroeconomic implications, 
including disrupted supply chains, fluctuating currency values, and heightened market volatility. 
The escalation in trade conflicts has not only affected bilateral trade relationships but has also 
introduced systemic risks that permeate global financial markets. Industries reliant on 
international trade face uncertainties that can lead to reduced corporate earnings, stock market 
downturns, and increased inflationary pressures. For a hedge fund like TQM, which manages 
portfolios sensitive to global economic indicators, these macroeconomic disturbances 
necessitate a robust hedging strategy to safeguard assets and maintain portfolio performance. 
Recognizing the potential adverse impacts of these trade tensions on its diversified portfolios, 
TQM's chief portfolio manager has sought the expertise of a consulting firm to devise an optimal 
hedging policy. The objective is to mitigate the current and foreseeable risks stemming from 
geopolitical instability and to ensure that the fund's portfolios remain resilient in the face of 
ongoing economic uncertainties. 
TQM oversees four distinct portfolios, each aligned with specific global indices to capture diverse 
market segments. Below is an overview of each portfolio: 
• 
Portfolio 1: MSCI World Index Replication 
o Current Value: $500,000,000 
o Description: Comprising a diversified set of global equities, this portfolio mirrors 
the performance of the MSCI World Index, offering broad exposure to developed 
markets across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. 
• 
Portfolio 2: MSCI Emerging Markets Index Replication 
o Current Value: $200,000,000 
o Description: Focused on high-growth regions, this portfolio seeks to replicate the 
MSCI Emerging Markets Index, encompassing stocks from developing economies 
with significant expansion potential in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle 
East. 
• 
Portfolio 3: MSCI Europe Index Replication

CASE STUDY: PORTFOLIO HEDGING WITH FUTURES 
o Current Value: $175,000,000 
o Description: Concentrated on European equities, this portfolio tracks the MSCI 
Europe Index, providing exposure to companies across various European 
countries, including those directly impacted by trade policies between the US and 
Europe. 
• 
Portfolio 4: MSCI Pacific Index Replication 
o Current Value: $160,000,000 
o Description: Targeting the Asia-Pacific region, this portfolio mirrors the MSCI 
Pacific Index, including major economies like Japan, Australia, South Korea, and 
others in the Pacific Rim, which are at the forefront of retaliatory trade measures. 
Amidst the backdrop of rising tariffs and retaliatory trade measures, the chief portfolio 
manager of TQM is concerned about the potential market volatility and its adverse effects on 
the fund's portfolios. The primary objective of engaging the consulting firm is to: 
• 
Assess Current Risk Exposure: Understand how geopolitical tensions are influencing the 
performance and risk profiles of each portfolio. 
• 
Develop an Effective Hedging Strategy: Implement hedging mechanisms that can 
protect portfolio values against anticipated market downturns and volatility resulting 
from trade conflicts. 
• 
Optimize Hedge Efficiency: Ensure that the hedging policies balance risk mitigation with 
cost-effectiveness, avoiding over-hedging that could erode potential returns. 
To achieve the hedging objectives, the consulting firm has identified the use of futures 
contracts on major indices that correlate with TQM's portfolios. The available futures 
instruments and their specifications are as follows:

CASE STUDY: PORTFOLIO HEDGING WITH FUTURES 
Use the following analyses to provide a recommendation about the best hedging policy for the 
company. 
A. The first type of policy would be to hedge the portfolios individually. The bank is exploring 
combinations of the following contracts: e-mini S&P 500 futures, Nikkei 225 USD futures, 
e-mini FTSE emerging index futures, and e-mini FTSE China 50 Index Futures.  
a) For each portfolio, compute the correlation between its returns and those of each 
futures. Employ one-week returns in your calculations. To compute portfolio returns, 
use 
the 
time-series 
of 
the 
indexes 
provided 
in 
the 
file 
“Hedging_PortfolioValue_21.xls” (spread sheet “Indexes”). For instance, the weekly 
returns of Portfolio 1 should be computed from the MSCI global index prices. For 
futures returns, their historical prices are in the same file (spread sheet “Futures” 
contains weekly observations for the continuous contract). In addition, estimate the 
volatility of each portfolio and the correlation matrix between the portfolios’ returns. 
Estimate the overall portfolio’s volatility using the correlation matrix, the individual 
portfolio volatilities, and the relative weights of each portfolio (annualize the overall 
portfolio’s volatility by multiplying the weakly estimate by sqrt(52) ).  
b) Use the following regression model to determine the optimal hedging ratio: 
𝐼𝑡= 𝛼+ 𝛽𝐹𝑡+ 𝜀𝑡. 
In the above equation, I is the one-week return of a given portfolio, F is the one-week 
return of the e-mini S&P 500 futures contract, and the last term is the error term in 
the regression. How many contracts are required to hedge each portfolio? Provide a 
table in which you give the parameters of each regression (intercept, slope, R^2, t-
stat for the slope parameter).
